          <h3>My Favorite moovies are : </h3>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong> Interstellar</strong> directed by Christohper Nolan in 2014. I like it for its dynamism and the sci-fi emotionnal way to spark you. </li>

              <li> <strong> Gladiator</strong> directed by Ridley Scott in 2000. In my opinion, it's the best peplum ever directed. Great cast with Russel crowe (Maximus) due to his animality and emotions.</li>

              <li> <strong> Fight Club</strong> by David Fincher (1990). The contempt of consumerism mixed up with the scenario sparked me. Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's performance brings the iceing on the cake to make Fight Club one of the best film in the world üåç</li>

          <h3> Why makes cinema a great experience</h3>
          <h4> Due to its subjectivity, cinema brings conflicts where the urge of stay calm and reasonnable is difficult. And that's the point, you have to listen and accept judgement in order to build your own opinion.
          Thanks to the youtube channel, In the Panda i can discover unknown film. </h4>

          <h3>The 7th art, but the best of all üçø </h3>
          <h4> Cinema is the 7th art, it is a very diverse art which allows everyone to find a film that they will like. Passing from the western of Sergio Leone to the drama of Lars von Treer. Cinema more than just a work of art brings real emotions.</h4>
